# Social-Network-App
NoSQL social media app built using Express and Mongoose

This challenge features the back end of a social network app built using Express and Mongoose.
The back end was built through the addition of routes, models for a user and thought/reaction,
and each of the needed controllers for the server to run smoothly. The user may start the app
using 'npm start', and once it's put, each route can be tested on Insomnia to see that adding,
updating, and deleting users is possible, along with the same functions for friends, thoughts,
and reactions.
